Kailey's Suggestions:
 - When students schedule appointments with advisors, allow advisors to add this appointment to their schedule. Send students reminders about their advising appointments.
 - Give certain users organizer privileges, allowing them to create community-wide events (e.g. UA sporting events, Honors events, etc.)
 - During registration, remind users to register for classes and suggest a good time to do so.
 - Take demographic information from UAccess incl.:
    - Advisors
    - Dorm
    - Class Schedule
    - Class Standing (Freshman, Sophomore, etc.)
   Use this information to recommend events to users
